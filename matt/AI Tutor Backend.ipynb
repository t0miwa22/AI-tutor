Here's a walkthrough for the hint:\\n\\nThe hint suggests using the `rank()` function to handle edge cases and sort the result based on profits in descending order. Let's break it down step by step:\\n\\n1. First, we need to calculate the sum of profits for each company. We can do this by grouping the data by company and using the `sum()` function. The query would look like this:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT company, \\n       SUM(profits) AS profit\\nFROM forbes_global_2010_2014\\nGROUP BY company\\n```\\n\\n2. Next, we need to assign a rank to each company based on their profit. We can achieve this by using the `rank()` function with the `OVER()` clause. The `OVER()` clause allows us to define the ordering and partitioning for the ranking. In this case, we want to order by profit in descending order. The query would look like this:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT *,\\n       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY profit DESC) AS rank\\nFROM (\\n    SELECT company, \\n           SUM(profits) AS profit\\n    FROM forbes_global_2010_2014\\n    GROUP BY company\\n) sq\\n```\\n\\n3. Finally, we need to select the top 3 companies based on their rank. We can achieve this by adding an outer query that filters the result by the rank. The final query would look like this:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT company, profit\\nFROM (\\n    SELECT *,\\n           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY profit DESC) AS rank\\n    FROM (\\n        SELECT company, \\n               SUM(profits) AS profit\\n        FROM forbes_global_2010_2014\\n        GROUP BY company\\n    ) sq\\n) sq2\\nWHERE rank <= 3\\n```\\n\\nThis query will return the top 3 most profitable companies in the entire world, along with their corresponding profit values.

The middle subquery adds a rank column to the result of the innermost subquery. It uses the `rank()` function with the `OVER()` clause to assign ranks to each company based on their profit. The ordering for ranking is specified as profit in descending order. The result of this subquery is a table with three columns: company, profit, and rank.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT *,\\n       rank() OVER (ORDER BY profit DESC) as rank\\nFROM\\n  (SELECT company,\\n          sum(profits) AS profit\\n   FROM forbes_global_2010_2014\\n   GROUP BY company) sq\\n```\\n\\n3. The outermost query selects the company and profit columns from the result of the middle subquery.
