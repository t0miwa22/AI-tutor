By grouping the records based on the \"NOC\" column, we can create separate groups for each country.\\n\\nBy combining these steps, we can group the records by the country (NOC) and find the minimum value of the year column for each group.

    "You can assign a variable based on a conditional statement inside a function. However, any variable defined inside a function in Python is local to that function, and it can't be accessed outside of the function unless it's returned or made global. \n",

    "my_result = check_condition(True)\n",
    "print(my_result)  # prints: The condition was True.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use a `return` statement, you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use a global variable:** You can define a variable outside the function and use the `global` keyword inside the function to tell Python that you want to use the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = None\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_condition(condition):\n",
    "    global result\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        result = \"The condition was True.\"\n",
    "    else:\n",

    "# usage\n",
    "check_condition(True)\n",
    "print(result)  # prints: The condition was True.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use mutable data types:** If you use a mutable data type like a list or a dictionary, changes made inside the function will be reflected outside of it, because the function receives a reference to the original data, not a copy of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_condition(condition, result):\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        result.append(\"The condition was True.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",

    "my_result = []\n",
    "check_condition(True, my_result)\n",
    "print(my_result)  # prints: ['The condition was True.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has its pros and cons. Using global variables can make code harder to understand and debug, especially in larger programs, because it's not immediately clear where the variable is being changed. Using mutable data types can make your code more complex, especially if the function needs to change multiple values. In general, using `return` is the simplest and most straightforward way to get data out of a function."
